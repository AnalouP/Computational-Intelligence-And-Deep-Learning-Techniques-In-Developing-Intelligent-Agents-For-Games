# Computational Intelligence And Deep Learning Techniques In Developing Intelligent Agents For Games

The aim of this work is the analysis and study of computer intelligence and in-depth learning techniques in the development of intelligent gaming agents. In other words, the aim of this work is to methodologically compare the deep learning techniques PPO, A2C, DQN and QR-DQN that have been proposed for games. For this reason, systematic experiments were performed on the Atari game environments of OpenAI Gym: MsPacman, SpaceInvaders and Q*bert, in order to compare deep reinforcing learning techniques in terms of their performance, training time and convergence time. In addition, more modern techniques such as learning spatial representations were used on the same environments to compare state representation learning methods in terms of f1 score and accuracy.
